## Common security vulnerabilities in web applications

An excellent start to understanding vulnerabilities is being aware of the Open Web Application Security Project, also known as OWASP (https://www.owasp.org). Among the common vulnerabilities that you should be aware of, you’ll find these:
* Broken authentication
* Session fixation
* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
* Injections
* Sensitive data exposure
* Lack of method access control
* Using dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### Broken authentication

We can say that we have a broken authorization if a an individual with bad intentions somehow gains access to functionality or data that doesn’t belong to them.
