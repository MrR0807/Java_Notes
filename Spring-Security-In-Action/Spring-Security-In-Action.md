# Chapter 1. Security today

## Common security vulnerabilities in web applications

An excellent start to understanding vulnerabilities is being aware of the Open Web Application Security Project, also known as OWASP (https://www.owasp.org). Among the common vulnerabilities that you should be aware of, you’ll find these:
* Broken authentication
* Session fixation
* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
* Injections
* Sensitive data exposure
* Lack of method access control
* Using dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### Broken authentication

We can say that we have a broken authorization if a an individual with bad intentions somehow gains access to functionality or data that doesn’t belong to them. An authenticated user can access the /products/{name} endpoint. From the browser, a web app calls this endpoint to retrieve and display the user’s products from a database. But what happens if the app doesn’t validate to whom the products belong when returning these? Some user could find a way to get the details of another user.

### What is session fixation?

Session fixation vulnerability is a more specific, high-severity weakness of a web application. If present, it permits an attacker to impersonate a valid user by reusing a previously generated session ID. This vulnerability can happen if, during the authentication process, the web application does not assign a unique session ID. This can potentially lead to the reuse of existing session IDs. Exploiting this vulnerability consists of obtaining a valid session ID and making the intended victim’s browser use it.
Depending on how you implement your web application, there are various ways an individual can use this vulnerability. For example, if the application provides the session ID in the URL, then the victim could be tricked into clicking on a malicious link. If the application uses a hidden attribute, the attacker can fool the victim into using a foreign form and then post the action to the server. If the application stores the value of the session in a cookie, then the attacker can inject a script and force the victim’s browser to execute it.

### What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?

Cross-site scripting, also referred to as XSS, allows the injection of client-side scripts into web services exposed by the server, thereby permitting other users to run these. Before being used or even stored, you should properly “sanitize” the request to avoid undesired executions of foreign scripts. 

Let’s take an example. A user posts a message or a comment in a web application. After posting the message, the site displays it so that everybody visiting the page can see it.

### What is cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities are also common in web applications. CSRF attacks assume that a URL that calls an action on a specific server can be extracted and reused from outside the application (figure 1.8). If the server trusts the execution without doing any check on the origin of the request, one could execute it from any other place.
One of the ways of mitigating this vulnerability is to use tokens to identify the request or use cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations. In other words, validate the origin of the request.

### Understanding injection vulnerabilities in web applications

In an injection attack, the attacker employing a vulnerability introduces specific data into the system. There are many types of injection attacks. Even the XSS that we mentioned in section 1.4.3 can be considered an injection vulnerability. In the end, injection attacks inject a client-side script with the means of harming the system somehow. Other examples could be SQL injection, XPath injection, OS command injection, LDAP injection, and the list continues.

### Dealing with the exposure of sensitive data

we’ll deal with credentials and private keys in the examples in this book. We might use secrets in configuration files, but we’ll place a note for these cases to remind you that **you should store sensitive data in vaults.** By setting such values in the configuration files, such as the application.properties or application .yml files in a Spring Boot project, you make those private values accessible to anyone who can see the source code.

Be careful of what your server returns to the client, especially, but not limited to, cases where the application encounters exceptions. Having exception stacks in the response is not a good choice either.

### What is the lack of method access control?
