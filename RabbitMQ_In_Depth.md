# Part 1. RabbitMQ and application architecture

## Foundational RabbitMQ

### RabbitMQâ€™s features and benefits

* Open source
* Platform and vendor neutral
* Lightweight
* Client libraries for most modern languages
* Flexibility in controlling messaging trade-offs
* Plugins for higher-latency environments - Because not all network topologies and architectures are the same, RabbitMQ provides for messaging in low-latency environments and plugins for higher-latency environments, such as the internet. This allows for RabbitMQ to be clustered on the same local network and share federated messages across multiple data centers.
* Layers of security
