Forget Gradle for a moment. When you’re building and running a Java project there are two classpaths involved:
* Compile classpath – this is a list of dependencies that are required for the JDK to be able to compile Java code into .class files
* Runtime classpath – this list of dependencies is required to actually run the compiled Java code
