# JDBC API

The JDBC API provides a standard database-independent interface to interact with any tabular data source. Using the JDBC API to access data in a database hides the implementation differences that exist in different types of databases. It achieves database transparency by defining most of its API using interfaces and letting the database vendors (or any third-party vendors) provide the implementations for those interfaces. **The collection of the implementation classes that is supplied by a vendor to interact with a specific database is called a JDBC driver.**
